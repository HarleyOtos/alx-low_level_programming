* In computing, a hash table, also known as hash map, is a data structure that implements an associative array or dictionary. It is an abstract data type that maps keys to values.

* A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index, also called a hash code, into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found

* An associative array stores a set of (key, value) pairs and allows insertion, deletion, and lookup (search), with the constraint of unique keys
